# Database

> If you will be using migrations, you can name the file to be written in this task whatever you prefer, and then move it to the correct location in the migrations folder in the server configuration step.

In this task, you will write the entire database schema based on the stats obtained from the downloaded data sets.

After writing the schema, you must write a small script to populate the database with the downloaded datasets.

I will give you the database schema in an easy to understand format and you need to translate it into SQL.

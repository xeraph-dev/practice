# Introduction to Xeraph's practice

This book aims to document some projects to practice various technologies.

Some things I'm going to work on here

- Database Administration: You'll write the database schema, manage migrations, normalization, and learn some important concepts when working with SQL.
- Back-end: You'll write a web server following some best practices and learn how to structure a restful API for simple but powerful access, graphql for mobile devices or clients with limited access, and gRPC for inter-server communication.
- Front-end: After building the back-end, you'll write a simple front-end to use all the features provided by the back-end. You can write whatever front-end you want, a mobile, desktop or web app, you decide, I'll try to write one app per platform.

To also practice with git, I recommend making each feature on a separate branch and each part of a feature on a separate commit, and when you complete a full feature, merge the feature branch into the development branch.

All projects have my solutions in a step by step format with explanations if needed. You can disable it if you want.

In the [Tutorials](./tutorials/overview.md) section you can find some small and concise tutorials written by me to avoid repeating them in each practice.

You can to use [httpie](https://httpie.io) to test you api manually

It's highly recommended that you do a documentation of your API, [Swagger](https://swagger.io) is a very good option to do it.
